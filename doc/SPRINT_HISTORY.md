## How to run / verify locally

1. Start dev app (requires assets and env vars):

```bash
export LLM_BASE_URL=... LLM_API_KEY=... LLM_MODEL=...
cd <repo-root>
wails dev -tags sqlite_extension
```

2. Run backend tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

3. Build frontend separately (if needed):

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run build
```
