# SPRINT.md — AI Tutor

**Status:** Active roadmap for Persistent Queue Architecture  
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-13  
**Architecture:** SQLite-backed deterministic queue (NOT autonomous orchestration)

---

## Active Roadmap (Production Proofing, RAG, & Rescue Pipeline)

### Sprint 10: RAG Setup, Asset Management & Environment Verification [DONE]
**Goal:** Make RAG and assets production-proof, verifying architecture requirements dynamically.

- [ ] **Task 10.1: Dynamic CGO & Vector Extension Verification**
  - Implement a startup check to verify if CGO/vec0 SQLite extension is present when RAG is requested/enabled.
  - If RAG is required by the user but DLLs or CGO dependencies are missing, show a clean error/fallback status instead of crashing.
- [ ] **Task 10.2: Asset Downloader Script**
  - Write a reliable Go/shell/Powershell asset manager command/script to download raw embedding models/onnx DLLs on-demand if missing in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ai-tutor/assets/`.

---

### Sprint 11: 2-Strike Socratic Rescue Pipeline [DONE]
**Goal:** Implement cognitive damage control via database clean slate, queue interleaving, and dual-lane rescue UI.

**Implementation:** 2-strike (`maxAutomaticRereadAttempts = 1`), not 3-strike as originally planned.

- [x] **Task 11.1: Database Intervention & Trigger**
  - Track consecutive quiz failures per topic via `reread_attempts` table.
  - On the 2nd quiz failure (after 1 reread), delete FSRS cards for the topic and insert `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` task.
- [x] **Task 11.2: Queue Interleaving**
  - `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` task type inserted at priority tier 6 (blocks queue until completed).
  - Quiz marked COMPLETED on rescue insertion to unblock main timeline.
- [x] **Task 11.3: Dual-Lane Breakdown View (UI)**
  - Split-pane layout in `SocraticRescue.vue`:
    - **Option A:** In-App Socratic Tutor (interactive chat with context-grounded leading questions).
    - **Option B:** External AI Prompt (source text preview + copy-to-clipboard for external LLM use).
- [x] **Task 11.4: Dev Mode Bypass Panel**
  - `DevForceSocraticRescue` endpoint for testing (requires `APP_ENV=dev`).
- [x] **Task 11.5: Automated Tests**
  - Tests validating rescue trigger, flashcard deletion, and `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` task insertion.

---

### Sprint 12: Cloud Dashboard Handover
**Goal:** Initiate the official cloud dashboard bridge and prepare the SQLite database for cloud sync/handover.

- [ ] **Task 12.1: Schema Audit & Sync Prep**
  - Verify every table has a globally unique UUID key instead of auto-incrementing integer IDs to prevent merge conflicts during cloud sync.
- [ ] **Task 12.2: Sync Status Metadata**
  - Introduce dirty flags (`needs_sync`) and modification timestamps (`updated_at`) on all core tables (`study_queue`, `notebooks`, `profiles`, `flashcards`).
- [ ] **Task 12.3: Handover Payload Endpoint**
  - Create backend endpoints to export and import user profile states as clean JSON payloads for cloud dashboard integration.

---

### SPRINT 13 User Asset Provisioning [DONE]

- Detect missing RAG assets
- Download assets from GitHub Releases
- Show progress UI
- Verify hashes
- Resume failed downloads
- Allow manual asset location

Refer doc/future_plan/cross_platform_asset_delivery.md

- Added in onboarding and settings

## Architecture Foundation

This application is: **A Persistent Guided Study Queue**

NOT:
- An autonomous AI tutor
- A mission engine  
- A hidden orchestrator
- A proactive scheduler

**Core Principle:** Advanced learning systems are **Data, not Engines**.

- Quizzes create queue tasks
- FSRS creates review tasks
- Remediation creates reread tasks  
- Examiner creates assessment tasks

**None of these systems own orchestration.** SQLite is the single source of truth.

---

## Queue Model

All progression flows through: `study_queue`

**Task Lifecycle:**
```
PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED
           ↓
        FAILED / SKIPPED
```

**Task Types (Priority Order):**
1. `FLASHCARD_SYNC` — Cloud sync recovery (highest)
2. `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` — Spaced repetition reviews
3. `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` — Socratic Rescue Lane
4. `REREAD` — Remediation tasks
5. `QUIZ` — Assessment tasks  
6. `READING` — Content consumption
7. `EXAMINER` — Mastery verification (lowest)

**Queue Ordering Rules:**
1. Task type priority (as above)
2. Notebook priority (higher = more frequent)
3. Task priority (explicit override)
4. Creation time (FIFO within tier)

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Queue Router

The queue router ONLY:
1. Fetches next pending task via ordering rules
2. Mounts correct module based on `task_type`
3. Marks tasks complete when module signals completion
4. Inserts follow-up tasks per completion rules

It does NOT:
- Dynamically generate agendas
- Proactively schedule sessions
- Own remediation systems
- Run hidden orchestration logic

### Dashboard Role

The Dashboard is now a deterministic task launcher. It does NOT plan missions or schedule.
